# Contributing to TraceLens

Thanks for your interest in improving **TraceLens** — a toolkit that parses PyTorch/JAX profiler traces and generates useful insights.

## 📋 Before You Start

> **⚠️ NOTE FOR AMDers:**
>
> **This is a public repository. Do NOT add any private, confidential, or customer-related data, code, or information to this repo.**
>
> Please ensure all contributions are free of sensitive or proprietary content before submitting.

- Read the [README](./README.md) to understand scope and architecture.
- Search existing **issues** and **discussions** to avoid duplicates.
- For new features and enhancements (new analyser, backend integration, refactor), **open an issue** first to align on approach.
- Prefer small, modular, focused PRs.
- **Have a ready-made utility?** If your utility is already developed, you can raise a PR to add it directly to `examples/custom_workflows/`. This lets the community start using it right away while we plan a tighter integration into the core library.

## Code Formatting with Black

This project uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automatically format Python code for consistency and readability.

### Installing Black

You can install Black using pip:

```sh
pip install black
```

### Using Black

To format all Python files in the project, run:

```sh
black .
```

You can also format a specific file:

```sh
black path/to/your_file.py
```

Please ensure your code is formatted with Black before submitting a pull request.

## Branch Naming Convention

Please follow this branch naming convention for all feature and bug fix branches:

```text
<type>/<scope>/<short-description>
```

### Types (type)

| Type       | Purpose                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or functionality                |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                     |
| `docs`     | Documentation update                        |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring (no functionality change)  |
| `test`     | Tests and test-related changes              |
| `chore`    | Miscellaneous changes (e.g., build scripts) |
| `ci`       | Continuous integration-related changes      |

### Scope (optional)

The scope can be used to specify which part of the project is affected, for example: `trace2tree`, `perfmodel`, `tracediff`, `docs`, `tests`.

### Examples

```text
feat/perfmodel/aiter-fav3
fix/tracediff/diff-reporting-bug
docs/update-jax-docs
refactor/trace2tree/remove-dead-code
ci/add-linting-automation
```

## Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. Example:

```text
feat(perfmodel): add perf model for aiter fav3
fix(tracediff): resolve diff reporting error
docs(readme-tracediff): add docs for jax tracediff
```

This format helps us to automatically generate changelogs and provide more clarity in versioning.
